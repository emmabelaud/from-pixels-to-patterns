## Land-use effects on soil fauna are temporally unstable

## Study description

Soil invertebrate communities were monitored at 6-hour resolution over nearly two years using eight buried scanners deployed across two contrasted land-use positions within the same Mediterranean agroforestry system: position **A** (unmanaged — treed cover with permanent herbaceous vegetation) and position **C** (managed — open cultivated area). By combining faunal activity time series with continuous measurements of root dynamics and paired microclimate indices, we apply a rolling-window piecewise structural equation model (pSEM) to characterise both the direction and the temporal variability of causal pathways linking edaphic conditions to soil faunal activity.

The rolling-window approach — fitting the model on successive overlapping 14-day windows advanced in daily steps rather than on the full time series — is central to the study design. It yields a distribution of standardised path coefficients over time, capturing how the strength and sign of causal links fluctuate across seasons and in direct response to management events. A divergence index is additionally computed per window to track whether land-use forcing compresses or sustains inter-taxon response heterogeneity.

## Study site

The study was conducted at the experimental agroforestry site **DIAMs** (*Dispositif Instrumenté en Agroforesterie Méditerranéenne sous contrainte hydrique*) established in 2017 at the INRAE experimental station UE Diascope (Mauguio, Hérault, France; 43.612°N, 3.976°E), under a semi-arid Mediterranean climate (mean annual temperature 15.7 °C, mean annual precipitation 511 mm). Soils are classified as Skeletic Rhodic Luvisols with high stone content (\> 60%) and a clay-rich horizon below 100 cm.

The system combines annual crop rotations with rows of black locust (*Robinia pseudoacacia* L.) spaced 17 m apart, each row bordered by a 2 m-wide permanent grass strip. During the study period, the cropping sequence was: durum wheat (sown Dec 2023, harvested 8 Jul 2024) → sorghum (sown 15 Jul 2024, mown 22 Nov, tilled 25 Nov 2024; irrigated three times in Jul–Aug 2024) → chickpea (sown 14 Mar 2025, harvested 10 Jul 2025).

## Hypotheses

| \# | Statement |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **H1** | Land-use effects on soil fauna are inherently non-stationary: their magnitude and direction shift through time in response to seasonal cycles and discrete management events. |
| **H2** | The indirect pathways linking land use to faunal activity vary over time in intensity, as the dominant causal mechanism alternates between microclimatic forcing and resource-mediated (root) pathways. |
| **H3** | Periods of strong land-use forcing reduce response diversity by driving convergence in taxon-specific responses, thereby transiently constraining the functional heterogeneity of the community. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Causal model (piecewise SEM)

All variables are z-score standardised within each window prior to modelling; land-use type is retained on its binary scale (treed = 0, cultivated = 1). Each structural equation is fitted as a linear mixed-effects model with a nested random intercept (`orientation / depth`) and an AR(1) correlation structure. A residual covariance term (`microclimate_1 %~~% microclimate_2`) captures shared physical drivers not represented by the binary land-use contrast.

```         
Tier 1 — land use shapes microclimate
  microclimate_1 ← β₁ · land_use
  microclimate_2 ← β₂ · land_use

Tier 2 — microclimate × land use drives root growth
  root ← β₃ · mc₁ + β₄ · mc₂ + β₅ · land_use

Tier 3 — microclimate + root × land use drives fauna
  fauna ← β₆ · mc₁ + β₇ · mc₂ + β₈ · root + β₉ · land_use
```

Indirect effects are computed as products of standardised path coefficients along each causal route. A total of seven pathway estimates are derived per window: five indirect routes, the total indirect (sum of the five), and the total effect (direct + total indirect).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Response diversity (H3)

The rolling-window pSEM is fitted independently for six focal taxa: *Acari*, *Collembola*, *Enchytraeidae*, *Julida*, *Gastropoda*, and *Symphyla*. Per-window divergence in taxon-specific β-estimates is quantified using the index of Ross et al. (2023):

```         
D(w,k) = [max(β) − min(β) − |max(β) + min(β)|] / [max(β) − min(β)]
```

D = 1 when taxon responses span zero symmetrically (half positive, half negative); D = 0 when all taxa respond in the same direction. The relationship between D and the absolute community-level β is modelled with a GLS incorporating an AR(1) error structure.

## Pipeline

Scripts must be run in order. Script 2 is computationally intensive.

| `1_database_edition.qmd` | Assembles fauna, microclimate, root, and season data into one analysis-ready table | `SEM_database.csv`, `fauna_vars.txt`, `microclimate_index.txt` |
| `2_SEM_diagnostic.qmd` | Sensitivity analysis over 120 (window × completeness × transformation) combinations; selects the optimal modelling configuration | `model_parameters.txt` |
| `3_SEM_modelisation.qmd` | Fits the full rolling-window pSEM for all taxa; computes indirect effects and the divergence index | `SEM_results_database.csv`, `indirect_effects.csv`, `H1_*.csv`, `DAG_*.csv` |
